# Terminal Watch face for the [GuruSR firmware](https://github.com/GuruSR/Watchy_GSR) which is for the [Watchy by SQFMI](https://watchy.sqfmi.com/)

I made some unhinged decisions early in the development process of this watch face and I haven't cared enough to change it yet.

This is mostly just a personal backup.

I might add pictures and clean it up for sharing at some point.

Quick overview of the 'features' in the mean time:
## Displayed on screen
- 12 hour time format
- 3 letter day + 2 digit dd/mm/yy date format
- current uptime (time since last full charge) + total uptime (time since first powered) cycleable on up button press
- battery percentage
- steps
- weather temp + icon in bottom right
## Misc features
- vibrates on hour change
- bottom right button performs haptic time, vibrating strongly once for each hour and weakly for each 10 minutes into the hour
- qr codes shown on button press
- once battery is (mostly) dead, will show a clean death screen. this draws a headstone bitmap with life and death stats which should persist after death due to eink screen
